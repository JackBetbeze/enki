About the manual
----------------
The best documentation - no documentation. It's better to have clear interface and behaviour
We hope, mksv3 does.

This manual won't try to cover full functionality.
If you are having problems with opening files, or copy-pasting text, probably you don't need mksv3.
But, some topics still should be documented...

Working with opened documents
-----------------------------

Sorting opened documents list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default documents are sorted by opening order. 
If you want to change sort order (i.e. sort by URL or file name), rightclick a list item and goto *Sorting* menu.

You also can sort documents manually, by dran-n-dropping items in the list

Opening files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open file dialog usually opened in directory, where current file located.
If you want to open file from directory "thedir", sometimes it's quicker to select in the opened files list
opened file from this dir, and only then press Ctrl+O, than navigate to "thedir" in the open file dialog.
