I've finally done the Vim mode!
The majority of editors uses arrow keys, Del, and long shortcuts to edit text. But in Vim it is possible to edit text with single clicks of alphabetic keys. I.e. you usually press `Ctrl+Shift+Left Del` to remove the word after the cursor. In Vim you need to press only `dw` (Delete Word). You edit the code much quicker and feel less tired after.
Looks weird, but once you got used with it you'll code like a ninja!
Get version 15.04+ and go to the *Help* -> *Vim tutorial* menu to try the mode.
