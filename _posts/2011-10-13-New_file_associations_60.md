# New file associations

I just finished file associations for syntax highlighting.

* Now it is possible to switch current langauge
* Now mksv3 tries to recognize file type by its first line

<table>
    <td>
        <img src="../../../../blog-screens/switch-lang.png" width="300px"/>
        <img src="../../../../blog-screens/detect-by-first-line.png" width="300px"/>
    </td>
</table>
