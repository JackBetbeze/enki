# New code editor progress

There where no any updated of enki for a long time, and sobody might think the project is dead.
Don't worry, I'm just developing new code editor component (QScintilla replacement). It is big task, but benefit is also very significant.

Currently, I've finished syntax highlighting. It is based on katepart syntax definition files, therefore **196 languages** are already supported!

The highlighter is non-blocking and even **quicker**, than original Kate.
