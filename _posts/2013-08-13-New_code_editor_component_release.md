# New code editor component resease

Today I've released Enki v13.08. This version is based on [Qutepart](https://github.com/hlamer/qutepart). It is new code editor component, which replaces QScintilla.
New features are:

* Bash-like Tab completion
* **many** supported highlighting languages

Some features, which was supported with QScintilla, are not supported currently. If you are missing something - let me know.

I hope you will enjoy Qutepart!
