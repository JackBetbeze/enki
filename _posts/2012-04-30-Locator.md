# Locator
I just finished functionality, which I was missing for many years.

Could you please stop reading this text for few seconds  and think, why all this hardcore linuxoids (like me, and probably you;)  ) love console and do not want to use GUI software.

I guess I know one of the 2 popular answers:

1. It always quicker to **type a command** than click buttons and dialogs or remember a lot of complex shortcuts.
2. powerful **Tab completion** makes typing commands even more effective. With it you can navigate in file system really quickly. Much quicker, than with GUI.

#### Tab completion
You type part of the word, press Tab - and your shell completes the word. This behaviour is similar to standard File open dialog, which you usually see, when press *Ctrl+O*

But, what is **wrong with GUI dialogs** and completers such as QCompleter - if you have more than one variant, you need more time to select desired one.

Let's imagine you have files:

* long-the-same-path-1.txt
* long-the-same-path-2.txt
* long-the-same-path-3.txt
* long-the-same-path-4.txt
* Xong-the-same-path-5.txt

and want to open `long-the-same-path-4.txt`

With GUI file dialog you would:

1. Press `l`
2. Either
    * click a variant with mouse
    * move you fingers to Up/Down keys and select
    * press Tab 3 times for selecting `long-the-same-path-4.txt`

Console shell completer:

1. Type `l<Tab>4<Tab>`

No mouse, no moving fingers to Up/Down, only 4 key pressing.
**Console allows you to open file much quicker!** Tab completion was invented many years ago. I really can't understand why it is not widelly used on GUI.

GUI sucks, but I decided to fix this situaition in enki.
I just added Locator dialog (`Ctrl+L`). It has:

1. Interface for textual commands
2. Tab completion for path

Now you can open files incredible quickly. It is even better, than Bash.

Currently Locator supports 3 commands:

1. Open file
2. Save file as
3. Go to line number

but I added API for it, and plugins can add own commands. So, Locator functionality will grow.
