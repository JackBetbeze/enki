## Why new code editor?
vim and emacs are really grate editors. 2 the best in the history. But original vi was created at 1976, emacs was started at mid-1970s. Time goes, world changes. A lot of new cool technologies has been invented.

Currently some programmers **spend a lot of time to learn and configure vim or emacs**. Than become fans of one of the editors and try to argue, that favorite editor is very intuitive, user friendly and it is absolutelly impossible to create better interface.

Other people **move from one ugly GUI IDE to another**, and finally understand, that all it is even worse, than vi and emacs. Some people never understand.

Vim and Emacs are powerful, extensible and hacker friendly. But not usable. Modern IDEs are beginner friendly, but often slow, force you to use your mouse and do not allow a hacker to work as productivelly as possible.

I'm absolutelly sure, that it is possible to **join all the best in one project**. I really can't understand why the open source comunity hasn't done it yet. **Where are heros of the new generation?**

I'm going to create next Unix text editor. Of course, such revolution can't be done by one man, but only by the comunity. **Your bug reports, suggestions, patches... are welcome!**
